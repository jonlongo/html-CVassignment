    <u><h3>Personal Sumamry:</h3></u>
        <p>
            An accomplished professional with extensive tenure in the building maintenance and construction sector, serving in leadership roles as a Director. 
            With more than 17 years of experience, I held Director and Shareholder positions in two commercial maintenance companies, 
            overseeing operations with a staff of over 10 employees. Managing a diverse portfolio, 
            the companies boasted a combined contract base of 180 individual clients. Following the successful exit and sale of these ventures, 
            I am currently redirecting my focus towards pursuing my passion for marketing and web development, 
            actively engaging in re-training for this exciting career transition.</p>

<u><h3>Work Experience</h3></u>
<ol type="I">
    <h4><li>Everest Home Improvements</li></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Sales Manager - OTE £65,000 PA</li>
            </ul>
            <p>During my tenure at Everest, I undertook responsibilities such as cold calling and responding to leads, engaging in sales activities, managing a team of five sales professionals, conducting monthly sales team meetings to review key performance indicators (KPIs), approving sales team contracts and facilitating their submission to manufacturing teams, coordinating with surveyors, and addressing all client inquiries and complaints.</p>
    <h4><li>Go Mobile</li></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Area Sales Manager - £45,000 PA + Bonuses</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In my role at GO Mobile, I was responsible for the day-to-day management of six shops within Yorkshire. This included developing marketing strategies, reviewing key performance indicators (KPIs) with the sales teams, handling stock ordering and conducting audits and stock takes. I also collaborated with suppliers to secure favorable deals, managed staff rosters, conducted staff appraisals, and reported to the Regional Sales Manager.</p>
    <h4><li>Sodexo</li></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Grounds & Landscape Operative - £28,000 PA</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I transitioned to Sodexo in pursuit of a career shift from sales following the liquidation of GO Mobile, a consequence of the parent distribution company's failure that resulted in my redundancy. Within Sodexo, I acquired a comprehensive skill set for executing landscaping and grounds maintenance tasks, complemented by the attainment of relevant City & Guild qualifications. Subsequently, I advanced into the property and building maintenance division, further enhancing my proficiency with skills pertinent to my role.</p>
    <h4><li>A&J Garden Services Ltd & NEMS LTD - 2012 - 2020</li></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Director & Shareholder of both companies - £60,000 PA + Dividends</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In 2012, I made the decision to leave Sodexo and embark on my self-employed journey. I established A&J in October 2012, collaborating with my business partner, Andy. Initially focused on maintaining domestic clients' gardens in North Yorkshire, our venture expanded into the commercial landscape maintenance sector in 2014. By 2018, we successfully managed 110 commercial sites across Yorkshire, the North East, and Cumbria, overseeing a dedicated landscaping team of eight individuals.
                In response to client requests in 2019, urging us to take on building maintenance alongside our existing landscape responsibilities, I founded NEMS Ltd. To bolster the company with the requisite expertise, I brought in two additional partners for incorporation. By 2021, NEMS secured maintenance contracts for over 100 commercial sites nationwide, with a workforce of seven full-time maintenance operatives fulfilling these contracts.
                In 2022, I strategically divested my shares in NEMS, following the sale of my business partner's shares in A&J in 2020. Additionally, in 2022, I sold all commercial contracts held by A&J while retaining my shareholding and directorship within the company. This phased exit aligns with my long-term strategy, allowing me to pursue my aspirations in web development and marketing. As part of this transition, I am scaling back A&J operations to focus on smaller domestic contracts independently, providing the flexibility to dedicate time to studying and building my new career and business direction.</p>
